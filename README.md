# Deep Learning with Keras - Radiomics
Perform a set of experiments with different Neural Network configurations and architectures. The system automatically saves all
the information necessary so that the performance of every experiment can easily be compared to the others.

This repository is a fork of my repo [deep-learning-with-Keras](https://github.com/decordoba/deep-learning-with-Keras), which is more flexible.
This one is only intended for the use in a Radiomics project I am working on, and some specific custom code for such project will be added, as well
as the interaction with the dataset I am using, which is not available to the public.

In order to maintain the original flexibility of [deep-learning-with-Keras](https://github.com/decordoba/deep-learning-with-Keras), I have decided
to separate them like this.

Most likely, only me and whoever may continue this project when I am gone are going to be interested in this code,
so for anyone else, go check out **[deep-learning-with-Keras](https://github.com/decordoba/deep-learning-with-Keras)** for a framework to see results
and find hyperparameters easily using Keras and deep learning.
